## Statistical inference in nonparametric/semiparametric models

When analyzing data, it may be desirable to assume a nonparametric/semiparametric model rather than a parametric model to avoid relying on strong assumptions. In this setting, the target of inference is typically an overall summary of the underlying data-generating mechanism. Examples include average treatment effects under various identifying causal assumptions (e.g., no unmeasured confounding or access to an instrumental variable).

I am interested in developing valid procedures for statistical inference of such summaries in nonparametric/semiparametric models, typically utilizing asymptotic theory. In particular, I am interested in those procedures based on asymptotically normal plug-in estimators, which respect known bounds on the summary of interest. I am interested in applying the targeted minimum loss-based estimation (TMLE) framework to construction of such estimators and exploring novel approaches of using TMLE to solving outstanding methodological problems.



## Numerical learning of statistical procedures

Traditionally, statistical procedures have been derived via analytic calculations whose validity often relies on asymptotic results. I am interested in using machine learning techniques to automatically learn statistical procedures that can perform well in small to moderate samples. In particular, I am interested in training strategies that can incorporate (possibly vague) prior knowledge into the learned statistical procedures in order to improve finite-sample performance in general models.



## Causal inference

I develop methods aiming at statistical inference of a useful quantity that arise from causal inference. Such procedures may be useful in both observational studies and trials.
