1. [BinomCont](https://github.com/QIU-Hongxiang-David/BinomCont?tab=readme-ov-file): A family object that can be used to fit logistic regression model when the outcome may be continuous and fall outside the unit interval. This is useful when fitting logistic regression to estimate a conditional probability function with pseudo-outcomes, which may fall outside the unit interval. It is also useful when fitting logistic regression when estimating a conditional mean function with known bounds while the outcome might not respect these known bounds.
