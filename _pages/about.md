I am a postdoc researcher in Department of Statistics at University of Pennsylvania. I am working with [Dr. Eric J. Tchetgen Tchetgen](https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/ett/) and [Dr. Edgar Dobriban](https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/dobriban/). I am interested in a variety of problems in causal inference, missing data, and machine learning. My goal is to make the most of all the available data and scientific knowledge to obtain valid conclusions without introducing extra assumptions that might make the results of my methods unreliable. To do this, I often work with semiparametric or nonparametric statistical models and leverage machine learning techniques to maximize the chances of obtaining valid inferences.

I received my PhD in Biostatistics from University of Washington. I received [2018 Donovan J. Thompson Award](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/news/doctoral-students-recognized-excellence) for best combined performance on the PhD Applied and Theory qualifying exams.
