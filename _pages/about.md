I am a postdoc researcher in Department of Statistics at University of Washington. I am working with [Dr. Eric J. Tchetgen Tchetgen](https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/ett/) and [Dr. Edgar Dobriban](https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/dobriban/). My interest lies in various topics on statistical inference under nonparametric/semiparametric models with the goal being that useful conclusions can be drawn while only assumptions with solid backup are made. I received [2018 Donovan J. Thompson Award](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/news/doctoral-students-recognized-excellence) for best combined performance on the PhD Applied and Theory qualifying exams.

I received my PhD in Biostatistics from University of Washington.
