I will be an Assistant Professor in the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at Michigan State University starting Fall 2023.
I am currently a postdoc researcher in the Department of Statistics at the University of Pennsylvania. I am working with [Dr. Eric J. Tchetgen Tchetgen](https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/ett/) and [Dr. Edgar Dobriban](https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/dobriban/). I am interested in a variety of problems in causal inference, missing data, prediction sets, and machine learning. My goal is to make the most of all the available data and scientific knowledge to obtain valid conclusions without introducing extra assumptions that might make the results of my methods unreliable. To do this, I often work with semiparametric or nonparametric statistical models and leverage machine learning techniques to maximize the chances of obtaining valid inferences. I have also worked on a cluster-randomized trial ([PROUD trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03407638)), contributing to the statistical analysis plan, the algorithm defining the primary outcome based on electronic health records, data quality checking, and statistical analyses.

I received my PhD in Biostatistics from University of Washington. I received [2018 Donovan J. Thompson Award](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/news/doctoral-students-recognized-excellence) for best combined performance on the PhD Applied and Theory qualifying exams.
