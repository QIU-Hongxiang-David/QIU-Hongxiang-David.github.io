I am a fifth-year PhD student in Biostatistics at University of Washington. I am working with [Dr. Marco Carone](http://faculty.washington.edu/mcarone/about.html) and [Dr. Alex Luedtke](http://www.alexluedtke.com/). My interest lies in various topics on statistical inference under nonparametric/semiparametric models with the goal being that useful conclusions can be drawn while only assumptions with solid backup are made. I received [2018 Donovan J. Thompson Award](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/news/doctoral-students-recognized-excellence) for best combined performance on the PhD Applied and Theory qualifying exams.

I am also working with [Dr. Jennifer Bobb](https://www.kpwashingtonresearch.org/our-research/our-scientists/bobb-jennifer-f) as a research assistant on a pragmatic cluster-randomized trial on opioid use disorder.

I received my B.Sc. in Mathematics from The Chinese University of Hong Kong.
